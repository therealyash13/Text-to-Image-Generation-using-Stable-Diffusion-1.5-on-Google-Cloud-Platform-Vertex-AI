### 1. Executive Summary
#### Introduction
This report details the development of a command-line interface (CLI) application for text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion 1.5 on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Vertex AI. The application, executed by Yashwanth Balan Arumugam, meets specific requirements outlined by Team Vermillio.

#### Development Tools and Technologies
Google Cloud Platform Vertex AI
GCP Vertex AI was chosen for its scalability and powerful machine learning capabilities, offering access to pre-trained models and simplified deployment of custom solutions.

####Stable Diffusion 1.5 Model
The project utilizes the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model, a cutting-edge machine learning model for text-to-image generation available through the diffusers package.

#### Application Features
Command-Line Interface
The CLI application provides a user-friendly interface with a simple command structure. Users invoke the application using the generate command and provide essential parameters.

#### Stable Diffusion 1.5 Integration
The application seamlessly integrates the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model, renowned for its image generation capabilities, efficiently operating on GCP Vertex AI.

#### ControlNets and Self-Attention Guidance
Advanced features include ControlNets options (Canny, HED, MiDaS, OpenPose) and Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) for enhanced image generation and higher-quality outputs.

#### Image Saving and Output
Generated images are saved to specified file paths and returned as output for user access and utilization.

### 2. Requirements
Installation as an Executable: The application should be installable as an executable and invoked using the generate command.
Stable Diffusion 1.5 Model: The application utilizes the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model for text-to-image generation.
Input Parameters: Text prompt, optional seed, batch size, optional path to an image on disk, type of ControlNet, flag to enable/disable a new artistic style, SAG scale.
Image Generation: The application performs text-to-image diffusion based on the provided information.
Image Saving: Generated images are saved to disk, and their file locations are returned.
ControlNets: The application utilizes Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) along with two ControlNets (Canny, HED, MiDaS, OpenPose).

### 3. Installation
The application is packaged for easy installation using pip. Install it with the following command:

###bash
pip install .


### 4. Conclusion
The CLI application for text-to-image generation on GCP Vertex AI has been successfully developed, meeting Team Vermillio's requirements. It showcases the potential of cloud-based machine learning solutions in image generation tasks.

### 5. Acknowledgments

## Demo:
### CLI Application using stable-diffusion 1.5
#### Command to execute
Once installed, the application can be invoked using the generate command. Example usage:

#### bash
generate --prompt "A fantasy landscape, trending on artstation" --seed 123 --batch_size 1 --image_path /home/yashwanthbalan75/generated_image.jpg --control_net canny --use_style --sag_scale 0.5
Output:

The generated output is organized in the "output_images" directory. The generated image file is named 'generated_image.png.' Use SSH to download the image conveniently.

#### bash
generate --prompt "A man is fishing during a tsunami" --seed 123 --batch_size 1 --image_path /home/yashwanthbalan75/generated_image.jpg --control_net canny --use_style --sag_scale 0.5
Output:

The generated output is stored in the "output_images" directory, and the image file is named 'generated_image.png.' Download the image using SSH.
